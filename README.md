# Conclusion
Our findings make us conclude that people with higher age should be targeted. This is probably due to the spending 
habits of younger people and the conservative habits of the older.
Target people when the euribor3m rate is low. This has shown to be strong indicator so the company should observe
this metric in the economy and plan its call when it reaches low levels.
People who were part of a previsous campign should be targed first as familiarity is a powerful persuasion tactic and they show higher positive responses.  However there are extremely few people as such. People with higher degrees in education are more likely to respond.By doing these targettings we increase the effectiveness of calls from 9.407% to 20.909% on the test set, more than double the sucess rate. 

With these profiles now, the company can target the larger population having the same characteristic. Thus, if we assume a 
total cost of X Rs, then the company would have saved around 10% of that so this project is quite productive in 
saving costs to the company.
